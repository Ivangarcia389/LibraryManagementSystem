<h1>Java GUI Library Management System</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This is one of the projects I created last year in Java. This application lets you create a login, in which your username and password get stored in a JSON file. It also has a search menu Unfortunately you can only search for the "Harry Potter" Book, and the
two Numbers books, "Numbers" and "Numbers Infinite." These books are stored in an array file. Later, I can update the application so the user can store books and search for them.
